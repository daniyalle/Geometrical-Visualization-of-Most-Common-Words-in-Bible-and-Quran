Introduction
This project presents a mathematical and creative approach to visualizing the most frequent words in the Bible and Quran.
Rather than relying on traditional word clouds or frequency histograms, this project uses coordinate transformations, Gaussian density modeling, and heatmap generation to create an expressive, spatial representation of word prominence.
*The database used in this visualization was generated using my previous work:
Document Analysis Platform with OCR, Database Management, and Levenshtein Fuzzy Search.

Mathematical Framework
This project is built on several mathematical and computational foundations:
1. Data Preparation
•	Word frequency and spatial data (average x, y positions and standard deviations) are obtained from pre-processed document analysis.
•	Centroid information is used as the basis for computing relative positions in the visualization.
2. Global Center Calculation
•	A global center is computed by averaging the x and y centroid values across all words.
•	This acts as the anchor point for all further spatial adjustments.
3. Angle and Vector Computation
•	For each word, a vector from the global center is calculated.
•	The angle (in degrees) of each vector is determined using the arctangent function (arctan2), ensuring that the directional placement of words is mathematically meaningful rather than arbitrary.
4. Angle Adjustment Algorithm
•	To prevent overlapping or overly clustered word placement, angles are adjusted using a custom function that ensures a minimum angular separation.
•	This adjustment guarantees both visual clarity and structural balance in the final plot.
•	The minimum angle difference is not hardcoded; it is adjustable and should be tuned based on a "try and see" method depending on dataset density.
5. Scaling
•	A scaling factor is applied to the resultant vectors to spread the words outward from the global center at visually appealing distances.
•	Again, the scale is deliberately adjustable based on empirical visual evaluation rather than fixed numerical values.
6. Fog Map (Gaussian Density Modeling)
•	Each word contributes a Gaussian-shaped "fog" centered at its computed location.
•	The standard deviations of the Gaussian functions are derived from the spatial variances in the original data, with additional non-linear scaling applied to enhance visual differentiation.
•	A gamma correction step is applied afterward to adjust the contrast of the resulting density map.

Visualization Strategy
The visualization process follows these principles:
•	Semantic Positioning:
Words are positioned relative to a global center based on calculated vector directions rather than random scatter, creating a coherent spatial structure.
•	Density and Heat Representation:
The fog map visually encodes word frequencies. Higher-frequency words generate denser and brighter fog, while rarer words appear fainter.
•	Gamma Correction:
A post-processing gamma adjustment refines the intensity of the fog map, ensuring that variations in word frequency are both visible and aesthetically balanced.
•	Annotated Word Labels:
Words are overlaid on their respective fog centers, with styling (background shading, alpha transparency) chosen to maximize readability without distracting from the underlying heatmap.
•	Color Mapping:
The Inferno colormap is used for its perceptual uniformity and aesthetic compatibility with scientific data visualization standards.

Tuning and Parameters
Several parameters are left intentionally adjustable to allow for optimization through experimentation ("try and see" methodology):
•	Scale factor for the radial expansion of word positions.
•	Minimum angular separation between words.
•	Fog damping factors for controlling Gaussian spread intensity.
•	Gamma correction factor to refine contrast.
This flexible setup ensures that the visualization can be adapted for different datasets or visual goals without needing fundamental code changes.
